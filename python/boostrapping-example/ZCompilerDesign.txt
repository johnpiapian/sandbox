I was trying to create a simple custom programming language.
After trying to do it a quick and dirty way, I found that it is tricky as it gets
very complicated very fast. So, if I were serious about creating my own programming
langauge, I would follow proper parsing techniques and etc as you would in a CS class.

The following link provides a formal guideline:

```


# variable
@x is 10.
@y is 20.

# arithmetic
@z is add(@x, add(@y, @y)).
@z is mul(@x, sub(@y, 5)).

# displaying
show @z

# condition
if @z < @x: show @z, or @z > @x: show @x, or show "nothing".

# loop
while @z > 0: @z is sub(@z, 1), show @z.

# functions
double(@a, @b): return sub(@a, b).
